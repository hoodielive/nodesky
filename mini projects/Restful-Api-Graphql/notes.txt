Routing 
  Flexible pattern matching 
  Handles parameters 
  Multi router support 
  Static & Dynamic configuration 
  Support for all HTTP verbs 
  Order based -> order DOES matter!
    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.json({ first: true }));  // this would run first
    app.get('*', (req, res) => res.json({ ok: true })); 

  Use different routers for different APIs 

  /api - router 
  /admin - router
  /analytics - router 

Like: 

const app = express()

const apiRouter = express.Router() 

apiRouter.get('/', (req, res) => res.json({ api: true })); 
api.get('/', (req, res) => res.json({ first: true })); 

The GET request will be responded to with first: true because though you created an api.get, the app doesn't 
know about it. You have to do:
  app.use('/', apiRouter); in order for it to be used.
